# Good to know
Although popular languages like Java and PHP have in-built switch statement, you may be surprised to know that Python language doesnâ€™t have one. As such, you may be tempted to use a series of if-else-if blocks, using an if condition for each case of your switch statement.


Example of switch in python
def switch_demo(argument):
    switcher = {
        1: "January",
        2: "February",
        3: "March",
        4: "April",
        5: "May",
        6: "June",
        7: "July",
        8: "August",
        9: "September",
        10: "October",
        11: "November",
        12: "December"
    }
    print switcher.get(argument, "Invalid month")
